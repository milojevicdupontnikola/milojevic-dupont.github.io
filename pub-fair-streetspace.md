Urban street space is increasingly contested. However, it is unclear what a fair street space allocation would look like. In this study that we conducted with students from TU Berlin as part of a seminar, we developped a framework of ten ethical principles and three normative perspectives on street space – streets for transport, streets for sustainability, and streets as place – and discussed 14 derived street space allocation mechanisms. We contrasted these ethically grounded allocation mechanisms with real-world allocation in 18 streets in Berlin. 

We found that car users, on average, had 3.5 times more space available than non-car users. While some allocation mechanisms are more plausible than others, none is without disputed normative implications. All of the ethical principles, however, suggest that on-street parking for cars is difficult to justify, and that cycling deserves more space. We argued that ethical principles should be systematically integrated into urban and transport planning.
