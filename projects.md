## Assessing how machine learning can help foster sustainable cities

There are high expectactions about the potential role of machine learning for sustainable cities, but the field is still nascent. I have written with colleagues several reviews on the state of the research on machine learning applications relevant to mitigating climate change in cities. A couple of others are in the making. I am also involved in education content creation at Climate Change AI, which includes for example a wiki. 

## Spatial machine learning + urban form

Increasingly rich data on urban morphology, land use, built infrastructure, offer opportunities of new quantitative analysis of cities, as well as predictive tools. With colleagues, we are developping approaches using machine learning to find energy-relevant features of urban form, to inform sustainable urban planning. We started with the simplest ML methods and are progressively aiming to develop tailored spatial machine learning approaches.   

## Gathering infrastructure data for sustainable urban planning

Even though more and more data on cities become available, there are still large data gaps that prevent potentially impactful research applications, for example comparative analyses of cities' infrastructure. I have developped a method to predict building heights from urban form, which we are aiming to extend to other metrics relevant for urban planning and urban studies.


## Large-scale models of energy use in buildings

The buildings sector is a large contributor to global energy use and CO2 emissions and requires widespread renovation plans. The lack of relevant granular data has constrained modelling efforts to inform such efforts to small scales, or coarse approaches. I am working with colleagues on upscaling current city-scale models to larger regions.
