# About

Hi, I am Nikola Milojevic-Dupont. 

I am a fifth-year PhD candidate, working on sustainable urban planning, with a particular focus on applying machine learning techniques to support data-driven public policies in urban areas. I am advised by Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/~creutzig/">Felix Creutzig</a> and affiliated with both the Mercator Research Institute for Global Commons and Climate Change (<a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/">MCC</a>), in the working group Land Use, Infrastructure, Transport, as well as the Technical University Berlin, in the <a href="https://www.susturbecon.tu-berlin.de/sustainability_economics_of_human_settlements/">chair</a> of Sustainability Economics of Human Settlements. I am also a founding, core team member of Climate Change AI (<a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">CCAI</a>), an organization of volunteers aiming to facilitate impactful work at the intersection between machine learning and climate change. At CCAI, I am the Content Committee Chair and a member of the Board of Directors.
