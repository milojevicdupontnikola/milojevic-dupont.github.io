# About

Hi, I am Nikola Milojevic-Dupont (he/they). 

///
ON THE JOB MARKET! 
*I am interested in industry and research jobs that focus on deploying (geospatial) data science to sustainability, urban planning, and other societal issues.* 
///

I am a postdoctoral researcher working on climate change mitigation, urban planning, and applied machine learning. My research broadly investigates the pathway from research to deployment of AI systems for climate action in cities, focusing on narratives, data needs, tool development, and practical deployment considerations. I am based in Berlin, Germany, and work at the Mercator Research Institute for Global Commons and Climate Change (<a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/">MCC</a>). I hold a PhD from the Technical University Berlin and wrote my doctoral <a href="https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/items/da94c4cc-c088-4b8d-836e-5cfc37d2c149">dissertation</a> on "Geospatial artificial intelligence for scaling low-carbon planning" under the supervision of <a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/~creutzig/">Felix Creutzig</a>. I am also a founding member of Climate Change AI (<a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/">CCAI</a>), a global non-profit aiming to catalyze impactful work at the intersection of climate change and machine learning, where I have taken on various roles including chairing the organization's educational content committee and being a member its board of directors.
