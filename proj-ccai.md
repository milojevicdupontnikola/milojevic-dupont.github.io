# Ongoing projects at CCAI

As chair of the Content committee and Community Lead for Buildings and Transportation, I participate to various projects.

The content committee currently works on five main projects:

- a <a href="https://wiki.climatechange.ai/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Climate_Change_AI_Wiki">_Wiki_</a>, a community-driven platform summarizing state-of-the-art knowledge and resources on various topics related to machine learning applications for tackling climate change. 

- a _Course_ project, where we aim to provide introductory knowledge on ML & climate change 

- a _Tutorials_ project, where we aim to create hand-on exercises to learn how to apply ML to climate change problems in practise

- a _Data_ project, where we aim to map the current landscape of existing/lacking data for important problems, including the availability of machine learning benchmark datasets, and to foster the creation of such dataset. See our <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/calls/innovation_grants">grants call</a>  

- a _Peer review and publishing_ project, where we aim to generate new publication opportunities for research on ML & climate change, e.g. through special issues in academic journals, and to reflect on peer review practices at CCAI

As Community Lead for Buildings and Transportation, I participate to different projects of relevance to these particular communities.
